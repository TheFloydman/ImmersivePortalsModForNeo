This mod changes a lot of underlying Minecraft mechanics. This mod allows the client to load multiple dimensions at the same time and synchronize remote world information(blocks/entities) to client. It can render portal-in-portals. The portal rendering is roughly compatible with some versions of Sodium and Iris. The portal can transform player scale and gravity direction.
