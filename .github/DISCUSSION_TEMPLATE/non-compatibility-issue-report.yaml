      If you don't know whether it is a mod compatibility issue, 
      backup your world and test it with only Fabric API and Immersive Portals mod.\n\n
      If it's a compatibility issue, please find exactly which mod is incompatible.
      Simply providing a mod list with 100 mods won't be helpful as the maintainer will not know which mod is incompatible.\n\n
      If you don't know which specific mod is incompatible, binary search is a way of finding the incompatible mod without removing the mods one-by-one. The procedure is simple:\n
        1. Backup the world (because removing mod cause its content to be removed).\n
        2. Remove half of the existing mods, and put them aside.\n
        3. Run the game.\n
        4. Does the issue still exist?\n
        If YES: Repeat from step 2 with the current mods.\n
        If NO: Swap out the current mods with the ones set aside, and repeat from step 1.\n
        5. Repeat this process until the problematic mod(s) have been found.\n"
